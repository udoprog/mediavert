## Music

The music is [Ghosts I-IV], by [Nine Inch Nails], which is released under
[`BY-NC-SA`].

It has been re-encoded to 32kbps because the purpose of this is to demonstrate
the sorting capabilities, not to distribute music. While mp3 is an excellent
format even at these bitrates I apologise to the artist.
